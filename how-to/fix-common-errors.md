### Common Errors
# PS1 error
ERROR: 
ng : File C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm\ng.ps1 cannot be 
loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For     
more information, see about_Execution_Policies at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

SOLUTION:
1. Go to that path C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm\
2. Delete ng.ps1, because for some reason you can't use powershell(maybe you don't have persmission or you have to open the terminal with administrator mode)
